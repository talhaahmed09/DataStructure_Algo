# Write a function called same, which accepts two arrays.

# The function should return true if every value in the array has it's corresponding value squared in the second array.

# The frequency of values must be the same.

# For e,g.

# same([1,2,3],[1,9,4]) returns true; same([1,2,3];,[1,9]) returns false
